<p>You probably heard about JavaScript a lot, most likely you have already written some JavaScript code yourself. But what is JavaScript? </p>

<p><strong>First of all it is important not to confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. </strong></p>





<p>Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks of Oracle. However, the two programming languages have no similarities (expect the name obvious) and have very different syntax and usage and for why JavaScript ended up being called JavaScript and also a brief history of JavaScript, I will put a link in the resources section. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-9fnjzmXWA" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-9fnjzmXWA</a></p>





<p><strong>JavaScript was born around 1995 at Netscape </strong>(at the time a very popular browser) as a scripting language and the goal was to add actions to websites, such as enabling to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate stuff and so on. So a lot of things that were normally not possible to do with HTML or CSS were now done with JavaScript.</p>





<p>Soon other browsers started creating their own version of JavaScript (like Internet Explorer with JScript). As you can guess this soon started to be a problem and the need for standardization started to become clearer. Later this standard was called EcmaScript. </p>





<p><strong>So JavaScript and EcmaScript refer to the same thing and can be used interchangeably.</strong></p>





<h4>So where is JavaScript now?Â </h4><p>The platform you are using now to view this video is using JavaScript. The same goes for Facebook, Google and even much smaller sites. Everything that changes dynamically on a page without being reloaded can be attributed in most cases to JavaScript.</p>





<p><strong>But JavaScript is not only used for building websites.</strong> Around 2009 node.js introduce a shift in mentality by offering a JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code but on the server side. So you no longer needed a browser to run JavaScript code.</p>





<p>Today JavaScript is becoming increasingly popular to create mobile apps, alongside with HTML and CSS. Or to build desktop apps (like Postman). </p>





<p>So let's see how JavaScript is used in the context of Postman.</p>





<p>The Postman App itself is build on a framework called Electron which allows for cross platform desktop apps to be created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>



<p>The scripts and tests that we write inside Postman are in JavaScript. </p>





<p>When using Newman to run a collection, we are actually using node.js to run the code that newman needs but our tests and assertions as well.</p>





<p>I hope this gave you an understanding on what JavaScript is and where it stands today and most importantly, how it applies to Postman.</p>
