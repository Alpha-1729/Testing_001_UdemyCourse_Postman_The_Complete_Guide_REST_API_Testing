# Test Driven Development

"""
>>>> TDD (Test Driven Development)
        It is a software development practice, in which the business requirements are converted into test cases before programming works.

        In TDD:
            1. We WRITE TESTS.
            2. We WRITE CODE.
        
        Why TDD:
            TDD ensures that business requirements are documented in tests.
            If there is a change in requirement or bug:
                First change tests and then adapting the code.
            TDD ensures better code quality in the long run.
