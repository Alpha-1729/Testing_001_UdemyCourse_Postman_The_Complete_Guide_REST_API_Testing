# Storing Configuration In Collection Variable

"""
>>>> Significance of collection variable.
        If we have 10 requests in a collection.
        And the baseUrl of the API changes.
        Then we have to change the baseUrl for all request in the collection.

        Instead we can create a variable to store the baseUrl and use it.
        Please refer the gif attached.
